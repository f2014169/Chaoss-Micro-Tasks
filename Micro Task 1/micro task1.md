**Task**:-Produce a listing of the number of new committers per month, and the number of commits for each of them, as a table and as a CSV file. Use the GrimoireLab enriched index for git.


Please change the necessary parameters in micro_1.py and run using **python3 micro_1.py**

I've tested the code using [chaoss mordred repository](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-mordred.git repository)

I've also atached the resulting csv files
