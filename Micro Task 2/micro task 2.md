**Task**:- Produce a chart showing the distribution of time-to-close (using the corresponding field in the GrimoireLab enriched index for GitHub issues) for issues already closed, and opened during the last six months.

Please change the necessary parameters in micro_1.py and run using **python3 micro_2.py**

**Note**:-You have to use your own github Personal access token.

I've tested the code using [chaoss grimoirelab-elk](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-elk)

I've also atached the resulting graph file (grimoirelab-elk.png)
