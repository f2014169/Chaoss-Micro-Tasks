**Task**:- Produce a listing of repositories, as a table and as CSV file, with the number of commits authored, issues opened, and pull requests opened, during the last three months, ordered by the total number (commits plus issues plus pull requests).

Please change the necessary parameters in micro_3.py and run using **python3 micro_3.py**

**Note**:-You have to use your own github Personal access token.

Make sure you have perceval python module

If not you can install it using

```
pip3 install perceval
```

I've tested the code using [chaoss](https://github.com/chaoss/)

I've also atached the resulting csv file and histogram (grimoirelab-elk.png)
